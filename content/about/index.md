## Life Story

It was in the year of 2013 when I wrote my first `helloworld` using Python. Back then, I was just a secondary 2 student, wandering aimlessly in life with not a clue of my future career. I was blessed to have gone to a school with a compulsory computing subject, for it was what sparked my interest for coding. Oh and I recieved an A for that subject.

Fast forward to 2016 when I entered Junior College, excited that I can finally change my CCA to the one of my dreams. Previously I had been in Scouts, my secondary school CCA which had taught me how to open up more towards others and exposed me to the responsibilities of leadership. However I had never been an outdoors type, and still am not, so I rushed excitedly towards applying for the school's Infocomms club. 

It was a fun 2 years of my life which I had won various rewards, and was what cemented my choice of pursuing a Computer Science degree in university.
