## Introduction

A 3rd year Computer Science and Mathematics double degree student in National University of Singapore, I'm currently looking for an internship for Summer 2021. Currently trying new things such as making websites, and practicing for interviews. 


## Future

Looking to specialise in machine learning and artificial intelligence fields. However one never knows what life has in store for them, and so I try to read up on everything to widen my horizons.


## Life Story

It was in the year of 2013 when I wrote my first `helloworld` using Python. Back then, I was just a secondary 2 student, wandering aimlessly in life with not a clue of my future career. I was blessed to have gone to a school with a compulsory computing subject, for it was what sparked my interest for coding. Oh and I recieved an A for that subject.

Fast forward to 2016 when I entered Junior College, excited that I can finally change my CCA to the one of my dreams. Previously I had been in Scouts, my secondary school CCA which had taught me how to open up more towards others and exposed me to the responsibilities of leadership. However I had never been an outdoors type, and still am not, so I rushed excitedly towards applying for the school's Infocomms club. 

It was a fun 2 years of my life which I had won various rewards, and was what cemented my choice of pursuing a Computer Science degree in university.
