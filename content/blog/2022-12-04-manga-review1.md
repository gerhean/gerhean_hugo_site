### TLDR

"How to Survive a Thousand Deaths. Accidentally Wooing Everyone as an Ex-gamer Made Villainess" is a charming otome isekai (reincarnated into an otome game world) reminiscent of Hamefura. Read this if you would like a comedy about a romantically dense, overpowered and diligent girl.

### Slightly longer review

Note: I arranged the panels from right to left.

The premise is extremely cliche, as reflected by the similarly cliche title. Our dear protagonist is reincarnated as the villianess, Claudia Ellington, in an otome game, in which said villianess is killed off in almost every playthrough. In fact being able to finish the game with Claudia still being alive is already quite the achievement. This manga manages to play every otome isekai trope straight, such as Claudia having a saint-like kindness, to even the 'game protagonist' falling for her.

Of course, cliches exist because they are popular, and this manga fully embraces this by turning them all up to 11.

Claudia is an extremely endearing and adorable protagonist who readers will find hard not to root for. Her use of 'modern world knowledge' is also very believable, demonstrating the typical knowledge of a game enthusiast and high schooler would have.

Despite being a well-off noble who could easily have had a laid back and comfortable life, Claudia enthusiatically takes on challenges and adventures despite acknowledging the risks that they may pose, constantly leaving readers on the edge of their seats. While Claudia calls herself the strongest 8-year old, the manga repeatedly reminds us that there are always stronger, more experienced and more influential people in the world, giving readers a reason to be invested in her growth.

In any case, don't read this manga with expectation to take away any deeper message than "being kind is good". Enjoy it for what it is, a hopeful, lighthearted and comedic power fantasy about a kind and righteous girl who learns about how to navigate an imperfect world, and is eventually rewarded for her hard work and perseverance.
