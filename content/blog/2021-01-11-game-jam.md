So the truth is that I had always been a lurker in the NUS Game Development Group (GDG). 
And so when they announced a Game Jam, I was initially hesitant to participate because I didn't have anyone I wanted to group with. However, I was eventually able to find like-minded people through asking in the group. Looking back, it was definitely worth it as it was a plenty fun experience.

This was the first time I ever did a unity project in a group, and we had quite a few problems when setting up a github repository. Whenever a unity scene was modified by multiple people at the same time, the merge conflict which resulted was nearly impossible to resolve due to how complex and long the file is. In the end, we had to agree that no more than one person can edit each scene file at any one time, and we used telegram to notify each other whenever this happened.


The game is currently still being judged, but you can try it [here](https://knotstoks.itch.io/majority-ruling)! Be sure to leave a comment too!

Here are some screenshots of the game!
